## Terms

[Bluesky's](https://bsky.social) - A social media platform
**TUI** - Terminal User Interface, similar to a Graphical User Interface (GUI) but in the terminal<br>
[Indigo](https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo) - Bluesky's Go API

## :alien: Who is this made for and why?

This program is made for people who love the terminal and want to stay in that environment.<br>
I created this because I love being in the terminal and still want to post things without having to go to Bluesky's website<br>

I also made this to give me experience working with Bluesky's Go API, [Indigo](#terms).<br>
This project is also just a subset for a larger project that will be recreating Bluesky as a TUI with full functionality<br>
(and perhaps some added features as well :wink:)
