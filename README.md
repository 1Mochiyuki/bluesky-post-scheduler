## Terms

**TUI** - Terminal User Interface, similar to a Graphical User Interface (GUI) but in the terminal<br>
[Indigo](https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo) - BlueSky's Go API

## :alien: Who is this made for and why?

This program is made for people who **LOVE** the terminal and want to stay in that environment.<br>
I created this because I **LOVE** the terminal, it's a lot more efficient for me to navigate around than in a GUI.<br>

I also made this to give me experience working with [BlueSky's](https://bsky.social) Go API, [Indigo](#terms).<br>
This project is also just a subset for a larger project that will be recreating BlueSky as a TUI with full functionality<br>
(and perhaps some added features as well :wink:)

## :question: What does it do?

- Post Immediately to BlueSky via a logged in account
- Option to save the credentials you log in with

## :star: Planned features

- Send images
- Alt text for images
- Multiple account support
